# Agent instructions

## Context hygiene across long sessions

You cannot measure your own token usage or trigger compaction — don't try. Instead, make compaction (automatic or manual) lossless by keeping state on disk:

- Keep track of progress in IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md when appropriate.
- In a long session, a completed increment is the natural compaction point — finish it, update progress, commit, then suggest the user run `/compact`.

## Decision reporting

Some choices you make while working are worth surfacing even though they didn't block you. Record them so they can be reviewed rather than discovered later.

- Log a decision whenever you: pick between viable alternatives, resolve an ambiguity in the plan, deviate from the plan, introduce a dependency or pattern not already in the codebase, or defer/skip something the plan implied.
- Do not log routine mechanics — naming, formatting, obvious refactors, or anything the plan already specifies.
- Write each entry as: what was decided, the alternative(s) not taken, and the one-line reason. Include a reversibility note when undoing it later would be costly.
- Append entries to a **Decisions** section in the plan document as they occur, and repeat them in the increment's commit message or summary so they surface without opening the file.
- Flag anything you are uncertain about explicitly rather than presenting it as settled; if a decision materially changes scope or architecture, raise it in the chat at the increment boundary instead of only logging it.

## Keep the codebase lean

Every diff should leave the repo simpler, or at least no more complex. Removing is as valuable as adding.

- **Swap rule:** when a change replaces X with Y, deleting X is part of the change — old code paths, obsolete tests, stale docs and comments, finished TODOs, all in the same diff. Never keep the old thing "for compatibility" unless explicitly asked.
- **Bug fixes kill the cause.** No special-case `if` shielding a symptom; re-derive the design so the bug can't exist.
- **Comments:** never narrate what the next line does. A comment earns its place only by stating a constraint the code can't express. If a refactor makes a comment stale, it dies in that refactor.
- **No breadcrumbs.** Comments must read for someone with only the source in context — no "as discussed", "per the plan", links to plan files, or step numbers. Process belongs in the plan document or commit message.
- **Reuse before adding:** scan for an existing helper or concept before introducing a new one. Two names for one idea is a bug.
- If something in the code surprised you or was hard to follow, that's a bad abstraction — flag it (or fix it, if it's in the area you're already changing). Don't launch drive-by refactors outside the current task's scope.
- Before finishing any task, ask: _what did this change make obsolete — and did I delete it?_
